Runescape Classic Scripts
--------------------------

Runescape Classic is an MMORPG, which released back in 2001. Sadly, RSC is shutting down in August. Before it shuts down I've decided to try my hand at creating RSC scripts.

My scripts:

**1. MD_cannonSmith**
  
This script makes your character smith cannon balls, so long as you have the required materials. <br />
Stand in Falador west bank with nothing in inventory and run script. Cannon balls require 1 steel bar to make!
